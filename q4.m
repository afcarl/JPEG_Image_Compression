%Observations:
%1)With c = 1, Entropy of the quantized image = -4785900, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 21.6374
%2)With c = 3, Entropy of the quantized image = -4787500, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 22.3920. At this point the distortions of the
%reconstructed image are just perceptible. So the highest value of c = 3,
%so that the distortions are just perceptible.
%3)With c = 5, Entropy of the quantized image = -4788400, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 22.9974.
%4)With c = 10, Entropy of the quantized image = -4787600, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 24.8226. The RMSE is quite higher compared to with
%c=1, so we can see that the image is distorted. On observing the image, we
%will find a lot of places where it is hard to identify boundaries, edges
%etc since the image is heavily distorted.
%5)With c = 30, Entropy of the quantized image = -4783600, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 31.7379. We can barely tell that the two images are
%the same. We can't identify any specific object in the image.

%We can see that the Entropy first increased as c increased and then it
%started decreasing even though c increased. The RMSE however always
%increased as c increased, since the image became more and more distorted.
