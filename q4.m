%Observations:
%1)With c = 1, Entropy of the quantized image = 0.3299, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 20.1380
%2)With c = 3, Entropy of the quantized image = 0.3304, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 20.9356. At this point the distortions of the
%reconstructed image are just perceptible. So the highest value of c = 3,
%so that the distortions are just perceptible.
%3)With c = 5, Entropy of the quantized image = 0.3311, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 21.6818.
%4)With c = 10, Entropy of the quantized image = 0.3338, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 23.4657. The RMSE is quite higher compared to with
%c=1, so we can see that the image is distorted. On observing the image, we
%will find a lot of places where it is hard to identify boundaries, edges
%etc since the image is heavily distorted.
%5)With c = 30, Entropy of the quantized image = 0.3512, RMSE of original
%and quantized image = 30.6674. We can barely tell that the two images are
%the same. We can't identify any specific object in the image.

%The images also get a boundary when we reconstruct it.
%We can see that the Entropy goes on increasing as c increased. As c increases,
%the image becomes distorted and nearby pixels start having more and more 
%different values, so the entropy of the image increases.
%The RMSE always increased as c increased, since the image became 
%more and more distorted.
