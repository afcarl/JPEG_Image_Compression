%Observations:
%1) With a value of c=2, the image almost looks as if there was no change
%to it, but the DCT matrices we are using after quantization have very few
%numbers which need to be stored (rest all are 0s) compared to the original
%DCT matrices without quantization.
%2) With a value of c=30, the image seems highly distorted, we can barely identify 
%whats present in the image. The DCT matrices after quantization, most of them just 
%have 1 value at the top left corner and thats all, so that is a huge amount of compression.
%3) I have used c=10 above, and we can see that the image can be identified
%easily but it does seem disturbed (imperfections etc).
%4) As we increase the value of c, the image seems to be more pixelated. We
%can see that the changes of colour across surfaces etc is not that smooth
%anymore.
