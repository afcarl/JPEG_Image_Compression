%Observations:
%1)In all the quantized DCTs most of the entries towards the bottom right
%are 0's and has a lot less entries that need to be stored compared to the
%non-qunatized one.
%2)The quantized images at 427,298 and 30,230 are quite similar to each other even
%though their DCTs don't match completely. In the DCT at 30,230 has only 1
%entry in the DCT which matches the top left entry of the DCT at 427, 298.
%3)The quantized image at 420,45 is somewhat like a colour gradient from
%left to right (brightest at left, darkest at right)
